### Say hi to the team!

- Kristina Bratkova

We met each other while enjoying our time at Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, but we never got a chance to work on the same project! So, we thought this hackathon could be a fun opportunity to do it and also take a break from all-things-Master's :)

Our motto (we just came up with this) is: **Open data and tools for global problems**.
