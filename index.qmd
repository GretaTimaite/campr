This website has been developed to support [**CampR's**](https://gretatimaite.github.io/campr/about.html) outputs for the [UN Big Data Hackathon Youth Track 2022](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/events/2022/hackathon/).

We chose **The impact of Climate Change on society as part of monitoring SDG13** theme and we had 72 hours to deliver a) presentation explaining our solution; b) 10 mins video; c) code. This website stores our presentation, video, and code.

Before you dive into this website, you might want to have a look at the **structure of the website** and what to expect in each:

- Home tab is where you are right now!
- Team tab is, well, about us ;)
- Introduction tab introduces the theme and its significance
- Data tab will tell you about the data we used and pre-processing it has undergone
- EDA tab is for exploratory data analysis 
- Modelling is for our predictive model!

We really want to highlight that we aimed to produce reproducible code with good documentation, so you can replicate it and reuse for your own needs! If something doesn't work -- reach out, we will be grateful.
