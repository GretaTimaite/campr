This website stores our presentation, video, and code.\n\n\n\n\nThe image has been borrowed from the UN website: https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13\n\n\n\nBefore you dive into this website, you might want to have a look at the structure of the website and what to expect in each:\n\nHome tab is where you are right now!\nTeam tab is, well, about us ;)\nIntroduction tab introduces the theme and its significance\nData tab will tell you about the data we used and pre-processing it has undergone\nEDA tab is for exploratory data analysis\n\nWe really want to highlight that we aimed to produce reproducible code with good documentation, so you can replicate it and reuse for your own needs! If something doesn’t work – reach out, we will be grateful."
