    "text": "What are the consequences of climate change?\nAn increase in Earth’s yearly average temperature can have disastrous effects on humanity. As The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022 summarise, climate change is “humanity’s”code red” warning” that has an impact on other sustainable development goals (SDG). For example, an increase in the frequency of natural disasters and extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, will have a direct impact on food production leading to increased food insecurity. While climate change affects everyone, the already vulnerable populations (e.g. Central and South America) tend to be affected the most. Indeed, the research suggests that “climate-driven economic downturns” might increase the risk for conflict, especially in countries that depend on agriculture. As a result, this is likely to further perpetuate socioeconomic inequalities across populations and prevent the actualisation of the SDG goals.\n\n\n\n\nThe image has been borrowed from the UN website: https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do people think about climate change?\nGiven the disastrous effects of climate change on humanity, it is not surprising that the the majority of people believe in climate change as a global emergency, even though there are regional variations. Indeed, experience of extreme weather events has been linked to changes in climate change attitudes and behaviours and personal concern for climate change have been associated with support for climate action and intervention.\n\n\nWhere does our project sit?\nHuman activity, such as burning fossil fuels, has significantly contributed to climate change. It has a negative impact on society through increased frequencies of climate-related natural disasters, such as drought or flood. Through exploratory data analysis we aim to examine the relationships between human activity and natural disasters. For example, is there a direct relationship between CO2 omissions and climate-related natural disasters? Is here a relationship between CO2 emissions and land temperature? What about CO2 emissions and renewable energy? An in-depth examination of such questions is beyond the scope of this project yet, exploratory data analysis (EDA), can support theory-generation that, then, might reveal causal relationships of the effects of climate change on society.\nSupport for climate action has also been associated with a personal perception of its consequences. Therefore, we are tried to examine the connection between personal belief in climate action, socioeconomic characteristics, and climate data. For instance, we asked if people with lower level of education prioritise economic growth because, likely, their income is lower compared to those who are more formally educated. Finally, we also tried to develop a model to predict support to climate action over economic growth in the hopes to better understand underlying causal mechanism."

    "text": "In this section the focus is on data sources used in the project:\n\nWhat data was used and why;\nHow were datasets processed;\nWhat problems and limitations were encountered and this might impact results;\n\nReproducibility: we used only open data and tools in this project to maximise reproducibility and promote open research. If one copy and pastes code from the code chunks in this document, it should be fully reproducible. Alternatively, one can examine R scripts corresponding to different parts of our analysis that can be found in this GitHub repository or https://github.com/GretaTimaite/UNBigDataHackathon2022\n\nData sources\nFor this project we used several datasets, which you can download from here:\n\nCO2 emissions per country;\nLand temperature per country;\nGDP per capita data;\nRenewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption);\nFrequencies of climate-related natural disasters;\nWorld data from {spData} package in R for country geometries;\nWorld Values Survey (WVS);\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) data\n\n\n\nGetting 1-6 data sources\nFirst we will download 1-6 data sources as listed above.\nSome of the data was provided by the Hackathon organisers, so exact source is unclear but they kindly allowed us to share them on GitHub. Thus, this is where we store the data.\nDo not forget to change the path to the file in the code below!!!\n\n# CO2 emissions data\nco2emissions = readxl::read_excel(\"data/CO2emissionsbycountry.xlsx\", # path to the file \n                                  skip = 2)\n\n# GDP per capita data \ngdp = readxl::read_excel(\"data/gdp.xls\", \n                         skip = 2)\n\n# Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)\nrenewable_ec = readxl::read_excel(\"data/Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).xlsx\",\n                                  skip = 2)\n\n# Frequencies of climate-related natural disasters\nclimate_disasters = readxl::read_excel(\"data/Climate-related_Disasters_Frequency.xlsx\")\n\n\n# Land temperatures\nland_temp = readr::read_csv(\"data/GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv\")\n\n# our world :)\nworld = spData::world\n\n\nSubsetting data\nWe will subset all data, so only data from 2000 to 2019 remains. The reason behind it that a number of countries do not have data prior, for example, 1990 as they part of the USSR and gained independence only after 1990. We think that data on the last 20 years will provide us enough longitudinal information.\nMoreover, we will drop some of the columns that will not serve us.\n\nco2emissions_clean = co2emissions |> \n  dplyr::select(c(1:2,45:64)) # select relevant columns\ncolnames(co2emissions_clean) = paste0(\"co2_\", colnames(co2emissions_clean)) # rename column names so we can identify them once joined with other datasets\n\ngdp_clean = gdp |> \n  dplyr::select(c(1:2,45:64))\ncolnames(gdp_clean) = paste0(\"gdp_\", colnames(gdp_clean))\n\nrenewable_clean = renewable_ec |> \n  dplyr::select(c(1:2,45:64))\ncolnames(renewable_clean) = paste0(\"ren_\", colnames(renewable_clean))\n\ndisasters_clean = climate_disasters |> \n  dplyr::filter(Indicator == \"Climate related disasters frequency, Number of Disasters: TOTAL\") |> # focus on total number of disasters\n  dplyr::select(c(2:4,32:51))\ncolnames(disasters_clean) = paste0(\"dis_\", colnames(disasters_clean))\n\n# land temperature data requires more attention...\n# we'll aggregate, so we have an average yearly temp instead of monthly, which is a bit too granular for our purposes\nland_temp_clean = land_temp |> \n  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(dt)) |> # extract year\n  dplyr::filter(year >= 2000 & year <=2019) |> # select data from 2000 to 2019\n  dplyr::group_by(Country, year) |> # group by country and year\n  dplyr::summarise(average_temp = mean(AverageTemperature)) |> # find out the average yearly temperature\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = average_temp) # reshape to wide format\ncolnames(land_temp_clean) = paste0(\"temp_\", colnames(land_temp_clean)) # give columns new names!\n\nNote: these datasets do not contain all the data that we would love to have. For example, land temperature dataset has records only up until 2013-09-01 (e.g. 2013). Thus, more recent data is missing and it has an impact on how much insight we can deliver. For example, if we are to examine the connection between land temperature and CO2 emissions, we would be able to do it up until 2013 even though we have data on CO2 emissions up to 2020.\n\n\nJoining data\nIn this section we will join all the data we have subsetted so far.\n\njoined_df = cbind(co2emissions_clean, gdp_clean, renewable_clean)  # Leave data on natural disasters aside for now\n\n# OK, let's drop some columns as they contain the same information\njoined_df_clean = joined_df |> \n  dplyr::select( -c(\"ren_Country Name\", \"ren_Country Code\", \"gdp_Country Name\", \"gdp_Country Code\"))\n\n# Join natural disasters data with our world\n# World data contains country's geometry shapes, thus allowing us to plot a map!\n# But first remove any NA values in ISO2 (we will use this column to join datasets)\nworld_clean_iso = world |>\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(iso_a2)) # remove NAs in ISO\ndisasters_clean_iso = disasters_clean |> \n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(dis_ISO2)) # remove NAs in ISO\n# Left join\ndisasters_world = dplyr::left_join(world_clean_iso, disasters_clean_iso,\n                                   by = c(\"iso_a2\" = \"dis_ISO2\" ))\n\n# Left join with land temperature\ndis_temp = dplyr::left_join(disasters_world, land_temp_clean,\n                            by = c(\"name_long\" = \"temp_Country\"))\n\n# Let's plot disasters_world for sanity check (uncomment)\n# tmap::tm_shape(disasters_world) + \n#   tmap::tm_polygons(col = \"dis_F2019\")\n\n# now let's join all the datasets into one grand dataset :)\nclimate_action_data = dplyr::left_join(dis_temp, joined_df_clean,\n                                       by = c(\"dis_ISO3\" = \"co2_Country Code\"))\n# let's plot avergae yearly temperature in 2012!\ntmap::tm_shape(climate_action_data) + \n  tmap::tm_polygons(col = \"temp_2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage temperature in 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData source 7 (World Values Survey)\nWorld Values Survey (WVS) is a global high-quality survey that collects nationally-representative data on values.

It contains data on various data on buildings and roads. We used OSM data to collect the count of renewable energy generators. For historical data we relied on ohsome dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of retrieving the total count of renewable energy generators in Poland from 2007 to 2022\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that OSM data might not be complete, with some countries having more objects mapped that others. For example, developing countries, such as Iran, might have just started to consider the crowdsourced data and examine OSM data quality while in Germany the community of mappers is large. Also OSM developed as a road mapping project, therefore other objects (such as renewable energy generators) could have started being mapped later at different rates in different regions. Therefore, it is crucial to consider OSM data with a pinch of salt when analysing results. Nevertheless we still consider that OSM data can provide interesting insights and provide data that otherwise would not be freely and openly accessible.\n\n# import csv file containing OSM data\nosm = readxl::read_excel(\"data/osm.xlsx\")\n\n# let's extract year from the date\nosm_clean = osm |> \n  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(timestamp)\n                ) |> \n  dplyr::select(-1)\n\n# save our new osm dataset\n# write.csv(osm_clean,\n#           \"osm_clean.csv\")"

Our goal is to ensure that not only we understand the data but also those who listen to our data stories. Indeed, interactive data visualisation is a great way to make data (and data science!) more accessible to everyone.\nIn the dashboard below you can visualise a variety of climate-related data by country over 20 years (2000-2019).

    "section": "Country-level EDA",
    "text": "Country-level EDA\nTo answer data questions we created an interactive RShiny dashboard! Our goal is to ensure that not only we understand the data but also those who listen to our data stories. Indeed, interactive data visualisation is a great way to make data (and data science!) more accessible to everyone.\n\nHow has climate change-related country data changed over the years?\nIn the dashboard below (Figure 1; link in the image label) you can visualise a variety of climate-related data by country over 20 years (2000-2019). For example, if you select Kenya and look at the “ren” (Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)) variable, you will see a drop over the years… Why is it a case? And what might have caused this drop? Perhaps there was an increase in total energy consumption, so the reliance on fossil fuels increased?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. R Shiny dashboard visualising climate data by country. URL: 6x2oh1-kika0.shinyapps.io/Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do countries stand in relation to each other?\nIn the previous subsection we explored climate-related data over time per country. It can show interesting trends, such as decreasing consumption of renewable energy in Kenya. But it might also be worthwhile to explore countries in relation to others. For example, the R Shiny Dashboard below (Figure 2; link in the image label) shows CO2 emissions in 2019. China and the United States emerge as two countries releasing the most CO2 emissions with China clearly leading the way. If you look at the CO2 emissions data from 2000 (co2_2000), China and the unites States still stand out but, back them, the US was the main producer of CO2 emissions. What happened during this time? Perhaps this change is a result of China’s economic development, but does this mean that it is also is the leading country for the consumption of renewable energy in 2019? Alas, no. Interestingly, African countries consume the most renewable energy (see ren_2019 variable).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. R Shiny dashboard mapping climate data. URL: 6x2oh1-kika0.shinyapps.io/Dashboard\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, we can see that the United States has remained, more or less, a leading country by the total number of renewable energy generators, while China is yet to catch up on this (Figure 3). Actually, the consumption of renewable energy has dropped in China (look at China in the EDA by Country). This is perhaps a result of increased economic activity, resulting in increased production of CO2 emissions but not expanding its renewable energy infrastructure.\nHowever, analysis of OSM data needs to be considered carefully as year-by-year change does not necessarily indicate how many new generators have been built. It might be a case that it used not to be a popular mapping object! For example, in 2007 there’s no data but it does not mean generators were not there. Finally, it needs to be mentioned that only about 50 countries are on the map for the pragmatic reasons – data for each country had to be downloaded seperately, thus making it a time-intensive activity. Therefore, we focused on countries that are also a part of WVS datasets, thus enabling some to join datasets to generate insights.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

In the R Shiny dashboard you can also explore this quention on a country-level rather than aggregate data per wave.\n\n\nAge and climate change attitudes\nWhat demographic characteristics might shape attitudes towards the importance to protect environment rather than boost economic growth? We initially hypothesized that younger individuals are more supportive of climate action rather than older generation. Indeed, in Figure 5 we can observe similar trend – younger individuals prioritise economic protection over economic growth, yet this tends to vary from survey to sruvey, with a notable example of wave 6 conducted right after economic recession of 2007-2009.\n\n# Reshape data for easier analysis\ndf <- wvs %>%\n  sel_mut(col = \"4\", new_col = \"wave_4\") %>% \n  bind_rows(\n    sel_mut(wvs, col = \"5\", new_col = \"wave_5\")\n  ) %>%\n  bind_rows(\n    sel_mut(wvs, col = \"6\", new_col = \"wave_6\")\n  ) %>% \n  bind_rows(\n    sel_mut(wvs, col = \"7\", new_col = \"wave_7\")\n  ) %>% \n  rename(env_opinion = env_num) %>% \n  mutate(across(everything(), factor))\n\n\ndf %>% \n  count(wave, env_opinion, age_num) %>% \n  drop_na() %>%\n  group_by(age_num, wave) %>% \n  mutate(total = sum(n), pct = n/total) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(age_num = case_when(\n    age_num == \"1\" ~ \"16-24\",\n    age_num == \"2\" ~ \"25-34\",\n    age_num == \"3\" ~ \"35-44\"\n  )) %>% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age_num, y = pct*100)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = env_opinion), position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  paletteer::scale_fill_paletteer_d(\"ggthemes::Tableau_10\",\n                                    labels=c(\"protect environment\", \" Economic growth\", \"Other\")) +\n  ggtitle(\"Protecting environment vs Economic growth\") +\n  labs(x = \"age\",\n       y = \"% of respondents in survey\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(wave), scales = \"free_x\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. A graph vsualises a relationship between age and support for environmental protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome and climate change attitudes\nOur previous graph (Figure 5) hinted that perhaps personal and global economic situation has more effects on climate action views than age. Indeed, this is further supported by Figure 6 which shows respondent’s income level against economic growth vs environmental support variable. Indeed, in all waves people are more supportive of environmental protection with an exception of respondents with low income in wave 6, which, as it was mentioned, was conducted right after the economic recession.\n\n# Regroup income levels\ndf %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  mutate(income_num = as.numeric(income_num)) %>% \n  mutate(income = case_when(\n    income_num < 4 ~ \"low\",\n    income_num > 7 ~ \"high\",\n    TRUE ~ \"middle\"\n  ),\n  \n  \n  # Account for changes in wave7 encoding\n  income = case_when(\n    wave == \"wave_7\" & income_num == 1 ~ \"low\", \n    wave == \"wave_7\" & income_num == 2 ~ \"middle\",\n    wave == \"wave_7\" & income_num == 3 ~ \"high\",\n    TRUE ~ income\n  ),\n  \n  \n  income = factor(income, levels = c(\"high\", \"middle\", \"low\"))) %>%\n  # Count people in a wave sharing same income level and opinion\n  count(wave, env_opinion, income) %>% \n  # For people in a wave sharing the same income, what's their total\n  group_by(income, wave) %>% \n  # Find how opinion varies among folks sharing the same income \n  mutate(total = sum(n), pct = n/total) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = income, y = pct*100)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = env_opinion), position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  paletteer::scale_fill_paletteer_d(\"ggthemes::Tableau_10\",\n                                    labels=c(\"protect environment\", \" Economic growth\", \"Other\")) +\n  ggtitle(\"Protecting environment vs Economic growth\") +\n  labs(x = \"income_levels\",\n       y = \"% of respondents in survey\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(wave), scales = \"free_x\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. A graph vsualises a relationship between income and support for environmental protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation and climate change attitudes\nFinally, we looked into education. In the Peoples’ Climate Vote it is reported that education is the most significant factor behind views towards climate change – more educated individuals tend to recognise climate change as a global problem regardless of their country of origin. The results of the report align with the insights provided by Figure 7. It is clear that individuals with higher education (e.g. with Bachelor’s degree) are more supportive towards environmental protection.\n\ndf %>% \n  mutate(education_num = as.numeric(education_num)) %>% \n  mutate(education = case_when(\n    education_num < 3 ~ \"lower\",\n    education_num > 4 ~ \"higher\",\n    TRUE ~ \"middle\"\n  ),\n  \n  # Account for changes in wave7 encoding\n  education = case_when(\n    wave == \"wave_7\" & education_num == 2 ~ \"middle\", \n    wave == \"wave_7\" & education_num == 3 ~ \"higher\",\n    TRUE ~ education\n  ),\n  \n  \n  education = factor(education, levels = c(\"higher\", \"middle\", \"lower\"))) %>%\n  # Count people in a wave sharing same education level and opinion\n  count(wave, env_opinion, education) %>%\n  drop_na() %>% \n  # For people in a wave sharing the same education, what's their total\n  group_by(education, wave) %>% \n  # Find how opinion varies among folks sharing the same education level\n  mutate(total = sum(n), pct = n/total) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = education, y = pct*100)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = env_opinion), position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  paletteer::scale_fill_paletteer_d(\"ggthemes::Tableau_10\",\n                                    labels=c(\"protect environment\", \" Economic growth\", \"Other\")) +\n  ggtitle(\"Protecting environment vs Economic growth\") +\n  labs(x = \"education_levels\",\n       y = \"% of respondents in survey\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(wave), scales = \"free_x\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.

For instance, we observed China emerging as a leading CO2 emissions producer over the last 20 years, yet it remains mediocre in terms of the number of renewable energy generators present in the country. Indeed, if you look, the total consumption of renewable energy has dropped in China. On the population level we noticed that there is a clear trend of more education people to support environmental protection. On the other hand, age and income provide less evident affects."
