**Climate change** refers to [long-term changes in temperatures and weather patterns](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change). While there are natural shifts, human activity, through burning fossil fuels, have had a tremendous effect on causing climate change. It takes a lot of energy to heat energy to raise Earth's surface temperature, yet since pre-industrial times there has been [an increase of about 1 degrees Celsius](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature).

An increase in Earth's yearly average temperature can have disastrous effects on humanity. As [The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022](https://unstats.un.org/SDGS/REPORT/2022/) summarise, climate change is "humanity's "code red" warning" that has an impact on other sustainable development goals (SDG). For example, an increase in the frequency of natural disasters and extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, will have a direct impact on food production leading to increased food insecurity. While climate change affects everyone, the already vulnerable populations (e.g. Central and South America) tend to be affected the most. Indeed, the [research suggests](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40641-017-0074-x#Abs1) that "climate-driven economic downturns" might increase the risk for conflict, especially in countries that depend on agriculture. As a result, this is likely to further perpetuate socioeconomic inequalities across populations and prevent the actualisation of the SDG goals.
