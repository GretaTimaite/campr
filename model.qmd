We have used exploratory data analysis to better understand what data we have and what can be done with it. In this section we will focus on building a model to predict the support of environmental protection over economic growth. 

We are doing this with support of [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) and [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai)!

## XGBOOST

There are several steps to create a useful model, including parameter estimation, model selection and tuning, and performance assessment.

First, is selecting the most appropriate variables for prediction.

In this section, we select the most appropriate variables based on previous EDA,

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
ca_dft <- ca_df %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  as_tibble()
model_df <- df %>%
  # Modify education
  mutate(education_num = as.numeric(education_num)) %>% 
  mutate(education = case_when(
    education_num < 3 ~ "lower",
    education_num > 4 ~ "higher",
    TRUE ~ "middle"
  ),
  
  # Account for changes in wave7 encoding
  education = case_when(
    wave == "wave_7" & education_num == 2 ~ "middle", 
    wave == "wave_7" & education_num == 3 ~ "higher",
    TRUE ~ education
  ),
  
  
  education = factor(education, levels = c("higher", "middle", "lower"))) %>%
  
  # Modify income
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(income_num = as.numeric(income_num)) %>% 
  mutate(income = case_when(
    income_num < 4 ~ "low",
    income_num > 7 ~ "high",
    TRUE ~ "middle"
  ),
  
  
  # Account for changes in wave7 encoding
  income = case_when(
    wave == "wave_7" & income_num == 1 ~ "low", 
    wave == "wave_7" & income_num == 2 ~ "middle",
    wave == "wave_7" & income_num == 3 ~ "high",
    TRUE ~ income
  ),
  
  
  income = factor(income, levels = c("high", "middle", "low"))) %>%
  
  # Modify age
  mutate(age_num = case_when(
    age_num == "1" ~ "16-29",
    age_num == "2" ~ "30-39",
    age_num == "3" ~ "50 and above"
  )) %>%
  
  left_join(feature_summarize(ca_dft, "ren")) %>% 
  left_join(feature_summarize(ca_dft, "dis_F")) %>%  
  left_join(feature_summarize(ca_dft, "temp")) %>% 
  left_join(feature_summarize(ca_dft, "co2_2")) %>%  
  left_join(feature_summarize(ca_dft, "gdp_2")) %>% 
  left_join(ca_dft %>% select(iso_a2, lifeExp), by = "iso_a2") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(env_opinion != "3")
```

### Fit xg_boost model

For the first part, data is split into two distinct sets, the training set and the test set. The training set (typically larger) is used to develop and optimize the model by fitting different models and investigating various feature engineering strategies etc.

The other portion of the data is the *test set*. This is held in reserve until one or two models are chosen as the methods that are most likely to succeed.

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# Load tidymodels and xgboost
library(tidymodels)
library(xgboost)
set.seed(2056)
# Split data
df_split <- model_df %>% 
  mutate(env_opinion = factor(env_opinion, levels = c("1", "2"))) %>% 
  initial_split(prop = 0.75)
# Extract train and test sets
train = training(df_split)
test = testing(df_split)
glue::glue(
  'The training set has {nrow(train)} observations \n',
  'The testing set has {nrow(test)} observations'
)
# Create resamples for model assessment
train_folds = vfold_cv(train, v = 3)
```

#### Create preprocessor

Feature engineering entails reformatting predictor values to make them easier for a model to use effectively.

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# Function for prepping and baking a recipe
prep_juice <- function(recipe){
  recipe %>% 
    prep() %>% 
    juice()
}
boost_recipe <- recipe(
  env_opinion ~ age_num + education + income + 
    ren + dis_F + temp +co2_2 +gdp_2+ lifeExp, data = train) %>% 
  # Pool infrequently occurring values into an "other" category.
  step_other(age_num, threshold = 0.05) %>%
  step_other(contains("age_num"), threshold = 0.05) %>% 
  # Encode dummy variables
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors(), one_hot = TRUE) %>% 
  # Near zero variance filter
  step_nzv(all_predictors()) 
# Just for sanity check
#View(prep_juice(boost_recipe))
# Create boosted tree model specification
boost_spec <- boost_tree(
  #mtry = tune(),
  trees = 50,
  #min_n = tune(),
  #tree_depth = tune(),
  learn_rate = 0.01,
  #loss_reduction = tune(),
  #sample_size = tune(),
  #stop_iter = tune()
  ) %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
# Bind recipe and model specification together
boost_wf <- workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(boost_recipe) %>% 
  add_model(boost_spec)
# Print workflow
boost_wf
```

### Model training

Boosted tree models typically have *tuning parameters* or *hyperparameters* must be specified ahead of time and can\'t be directly found from training data. These are unknown structural or other kind of values that have significant impact on the model but cannot be directly estimated from the data. Instead, hyperparameters are estimated using simulated data sets created from a process called resampling such as cross-validation or bootstrap resampling.

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
doParallel::registerDoParallel()
set.seed(2056)
#library(finetune)
# Evaluation metrics during tuning
eval_metrics <- metric_set(mn_log_loss, accuracy)
# xgb_race <- tune_grid(boost_wf, resamples = train_folds, grid = 7, metrics = eval_metrics)
# # Efficient grid search via racing
xgb_race <- tune_race_anova(
  object = boost_wf,
  resamples = train_folds,
  metrics = eval_metrics,
  # Try out 20 different hyperparameter combinations
  grid = 20,
  control = control_race(
    verbose_elim = TRUE
  )
)
```

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# Tibble with model with best accuracy
xgb_race %>% 
  show_best(metric = "accuracy")
```

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# Train model
# Train then test
# Finalize workflow
final_boost_wf <- boost_wf %>% 
  finalize_workflow(select_best(xgb_race, metric = "mn_log_loss" #mn_log_loss
                    ))
# Train then test
xgb_model <- final_boost_wf %>% 
  last_fit(df_split, metrics = metric_set(accuracy, recall, spec, ppv, roc_auc, mn_log_loss, f_meas))
# Collect metrics
xgb_model %>% 
  collect_metrics()
```

### Evaluate model performance

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# Plot confusion matrix
xgb_model %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = env_opinion, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84614994/201263094-c7df5a9d-7d52-4afe-bab9-35032d6cc171.png)

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# Prettier?
update_geom_defaults(geom = "rect", new = list(fill = "midnightblue", alpha = 0.7))
xgb_model %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  conf_mat(env_opinion, .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot()
```

The performance metrics considered are:=

Recall: `TP/(TP + FN)` defined as the proportion of positive results out of the number of samples which were actually positive. Also known as `sensitivity`.

Specificity: `TN/(TN + FP)` defined as the proportion of negative results out of the number of samples which were actually negative.

Precision: `TP/(TP + FP)` defined as the proportion of predicted positives that are actually positive. Also called [positive predictive value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value "Positive predictive value")

Accuracy: `TP + TN/(TP + TN + FP + FN)` The percentage of labels predicted accurately for a sample.

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# Collect metrics
xgb_model %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>% 
  filter(.metric %in% c("accuracy", "recall", "f_meas", "mn_log_loss"))
```

**Insights from modeling results**:

-   The model was able to correctly distinguish 60% of the respondents

-   The model has a high ability to accurately distinguish respondents who support climate action.

-   F Measure: A weighted average of the precision and recall, with best being 1 and worst being 0.

Overall, for only tuning the number of trees, the model performed quite decently.

## Model interpretability

In this section, we explore why the model makes the predictions it does.

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
options(scipen = 999)
# Extract trained workflow
xgb_wf <- xgb_model %>% 
  extract_workflow()
# Extract variable importance
library(vip)
vi <- xgb_wf %>% 
  extract_fit_parsnip() %>% 
  vi()
vi
```

Let's visualize these model interpretability results

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
vi %>% 
  slice_max(Importance, n = 42) %>%
  mutate(Variable = fct_reorder(Variable, Importance)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Variable, x = Importance)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "dodgerblue") + 
  geom_segment(aes(y = Variable, yend = Variable, x = 0, xend = Importance), size = 2, color = "dodgerblue", alpha = 0.7 ) +
  ggtitle(paste("Variable Importance plot of top", round(nrow(vi)/2), "variables")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# SHAP for xgboost
library(SHAPforxgboost)
# Prepare shap values for plotting. Requires a matrix
opinion_shap <- shap.prep(
  # Actual Boost engine
  xgb_model = xgb_wf %>% 
    extract_fit_engine(),
  # predictors used to calculate SHAP values
  X_train = boost_recipe %>% 
    prep() %>% bake(has_role("predictor"),
                 new_data = NULL,
                 composition = "matrix"),
  top_n = 8
  
)
shap.plot.summary(opinion_shap)
```

## Final comments

From the VIP plot, we can observe which variables most/least influence the model performance.

The life expectancy of the country where an individual lives in has the most predictive value for this model. This alludes to if the living conditions that lead to higher life expectancies such as health, diet/nutrition, respondents are more likely to support climate action. 

The proportion of renewable energy consumed by respondents was the second most predictive feature. Perhaps if people experience the viability of renewable energy sources and the positive effects on their cities etc, they are more likely to support climate action.

Other factors directly related to climate change are also considered important by the model in predicting opinion. As people observe effects of climate change, this would influence their thoughts.

Higher education of literacy and certain age groups are important for the model.

## Next steps

Consider SHAP summary plot that combines feature importance and feature effects with features being ordered according to their importance.

Explore Local model explanations which provide information about a prediction for a single observation and how changing a feature can simulate change in opinion.
