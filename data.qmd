In this section the **focus is on data sources** used in the project:

1. What data was used and why;
2. How were datasets processed;
3. What problems and limitations were encountered and this might impact results;

**Reproducibility:** we used only open data and tools in this project to maximise reproducibility and promote open research. If one copy and pastes code from the code chunks in this document, it should be fully reproducible. Alternatively, one can examine R scripts corresponding to different parts of our analysis that can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GretaTimaite/UNBigDataHackathon2022) or https://github.com/GretaTimaite/UNBigDataHackathon2022

### Data sources

For this project we used several datasets, which you can download [from here](https://github.com/GretaTimaite/UNBigDataHackathon2022/releases/tag/v0.1):

1. CO2 emissions per country;
2. Land temperature per country;
3. GDP per capita data; 
4. Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption);
5. Frequencies of climate-related natural disasters;
6. World data from {spData} package in R for country geometries;
7. World Values Survey (WVS);
8. OpenStreetMap (OSM) data


### Getting 1-6 data sources 

First we will download 1-6 data sources as listed above.

Some of the data was provided by the Hackathon organisers, so exact source is unclear but they kindly allowed us to share them on GitHub. Thus, this is where we store the data. 

Do not forget to change the path to the file in the code below!!! 

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
  
# CO2 emissions data
co2emissions = readxl::read_excel("data/CO2emissionsbycountry.xlsx", # path to the file 
                                  skip = 2)

# GDP per capita data 
gdp = readxl::read_excel("data/gdp.xls", 
                         skip = 2)

# Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)
renewable_ec = readxl::read_excel("data/Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).xlsx",
                                  skip = 2)

# Frequencies of climate-related natural disasters
climate_disasters = readxl::read_excel("data/Climate-related_Disasters_Frequency.xlsx")


# Land temperatures
land_temp = readr::read_csv("data/GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv")

# our world :)
world = spData::world
```

#### Subsetting data

We will subset all data, so only data from 2000 to 2019 remains. The reason behind it that a number of countries do not have data prior, for example, 1990 as they part of the USSR and gained independence only after 1990. We think that data on the last 20 years will provide us enough longitudinal information. 

Moreover, we will drop some of the columns that will not serve us. 

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F

co2emissions_clean = co2emissions |> 
  dplyr::select(c(1:2,45:64)) # select relevant columns
colnames(co2emissions_clean) = paste0("co2_", colnames(co2emissions_clean)) # rename column names so we can identify them once joined with other datasets

gdp_clean = gdp |> 
  dplyr::select(c(1:2,45:64))
colnames(gdp_clean) = paste0("gdp_", colnames(gdp_clean))

renewable_clean = renewable_ec |> 
  dplyr::select(c(1:2,45:64))
colnames(renewable_clean) = paste0("ren_", colnames(renewable_clean))

disasters_clean = climate_disasters |> 
  dplyr::filter(Indicator == "Climate related disasters frequency, Number of Disasters: TOTAL") |> # focus on total number of disasters
  dplyr::select(c(2:4,32:51))
colnames(disasters_clean) = paste0("dis_", colnames(disasters_clean))

# land temperature data requires more attention...
# we'll aggregate, so we have an average yearly temp instead of monthly, which is a bit too granular for our purposes
land_temp_clean = land_temp |> 
  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(dt)) |> # extract year
  dplyr::filter(year >= 2000 & year <=2019) |> # select data from 2000 to 2019
  dplyr::group_by(Country, year) |> # group by country and year
  dplyr::summarise(average_temp = mean(AverageTemperature)) |> # find out the average yearly temperature
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = average_temp) # reshape to wide format
colnames(land_temp_clean) = paste0("temp_", colnames(land_temp_clean)) # give columns new names!
```

Note: these datasets do not contain all the data that we would love to have. For example, land temperature dataset has records only up until 2013-09-01 (e.g. 2013). Thus, more recent data is missing and it has an impact on how much insight we can deliver. For example, if we are to examine the connection between land temperature and CO2 emissions, we would be able to do it up until 2013 even though we have data on CO2 emissions up to 2020.

#### Joining data

In this section we will join all the data we have subsetted so far. 

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F

joined_df = cbind(co2emissions_clean, gdp_clean, renewable_clean)  # Leave data on natural disasters aside for now

# OK, let's drop some columns as they contain the same information
joined_df_clean = joined_df |> 
  dplyr::select( -c("ren_Country Name", "ren_Country Code", "gdp_Country Name", "gdp_Country Code"))

# Join natural disasters data with our world
# World data contains country's geometry shapes, thus allowing us to plot a map!
# But first remove any NA values in ISO2 (we will use this column to join datasets)
world_clean_iso = world |>
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(iso_a2)) # remove NAs in ISO
disasters_clean_iso = disasters_clean |> 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(dis_ISO2)) # remove NAs in ISO
# Left join
disasters_world = dplyr::left_join(world_clean_iso, disasters_clean_iso,
                                   by = c("iso_a2" = "dis_ISO2" ))

# Left join with land temperature
dis_temp = dplyr::left_join(disasters_world, land_temp_clean,
                            by = c("name_long" = "temp_Country"))

# Let's plot disasters_world for sanity check (uncomment)
# tmap::tm_shape(disasters_world) + 
#   tmap::tm_polygons(col = "dis_F2019")

# now let's join all the datasets into one grand dataset :)
climate_action_data = dplyr::left_join(dis_temp, joined_df_clean,
                                       by = c("dis_ISO3" = "co2_Country Code"))
# let's plot avergae yearly temperature in 2012!
tmap::tm_shape(climate_action_data) + 
  tmap::tm_polygons(col = "temp_2012")
```

### Data source 7 (World Values Survey)

World Values Survey (WVS) is a global high-quality survey that collects nationally-representative data on values. The data is open to everyone to use for non-commercial purposes as long as data files themselves are not redistributed and correct citations provided. Given terms of use, we ask you to d[ownload data for waves 4-7 from their website](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp) and the recommended format is .sav (for SPSS).

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
# read waves 4-7
wvs4 = foreign::read.spss("data/WV4_Data_spss_v20201117.sav",
                          to.data.frame = TRUE) # import as dataframe (otherwise it will be a list)
wvs5 = foreign::read.spss("data/WV5_Data_Spss_v20180912.sav",
                          to.data.frame = TRUE)
wvs6 = foreign::read.spss("data/WV6_Data_sav_v20201117.sav", 
                          to.data.frame = TRUE)
wvs7 = foreign::read.spss("data/WVS_Cross-National_Wave_7_spss_v4_0.sav", 
                          to.data.frame = TRUE)
```


#### Subsetting

Each WVS dataset has loads of variables, yet not all of them interest us at this point.

We will extract the following variables:

- country
- views on the importance of protecting environment vs. economic growth (we use this question as a proxy for climate change attitude)
- sex (note: sex rather than gender is used in the surveys)
- age
- education
- social class
- income level

Also we will give more understandable column names.

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F
wvs7_sub = wvs7 |> dplyr::select(B_COUNTRY_ALPHA, Q111, Q260, X003R2, Q275R, Q287, Q288R)
colnames(wvs7_sub) = c("country_7", "env_7", "sex_7", "age_7", "education_7", "class_7", "income_7")

wvs6_sub = wvs6 |> dplyr::select(B_COUNTRY_ALPHA, V81, V240, X003R2, V248, V238, V239)
colnames(wvs6_sub) = c("country_6", "env_6", "sex_6", "age_6", "education_6", "class_6", "income_6")

wvs5_sub = wvs5 |> dplyr::select(V2, V104, V235, V237, V238, V252, V253) # I cannot believe this dataset doesn't have ISO code...
colnames(wvs5_sub) = c("country_5", "env_5", "sex_5", "age_5", "education_5", "class_5", "income_5")

wvs4_sub = wvs4 |> dplyr::select(B_COUNTRY_ALPHA, V36, V223, V225R2, V226, V235, V236)
colnames(wvs4_sub) = c("country_4", "env_4", "sex_4", "age_4", "education_4", "class_4", "income_4")
```

#### Recoding and joining 

In this section we will change variable values from character to numeric in the hope of easing the interpretation. 
Then we will join all four waves into one dataset.

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F

# find out max length of each, we'll use this information to create NA cells, so length of all datasets is the same
# then we'll be able to join them easily

max_length = max(c(nrow(wvs4_sub), nrow(wvs5_sub), nrow(wvs6_sub), nrow(wvs7_sub)))
max_length # wave 6 has most obervations

wvs7_sub = wvs7_sub |>

### Data source 8 (OpenStreetMap)

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) data is a global project aiming to create a free map of the world through crowdsourcing. It contains data on various data on buildings and roads. We used OSM data to collect the count of [renewable energy generators](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:power%3Dgenerator). For historical data we relied on [ohsome dashboard](https://ohsome.org/apps/dashboard/). 

<center>![An example of retrieving the total count of renewable energy generators in Poland from 2007 to 2022](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84614994/201127048-46d63ff0-0b5c-47ab-a401-7dfd2cd73351.png)</center>

It is important to note that OSM data might not be complete, with some countries having more objects mapped that others. For example, developing countries, such as Iran, might have just started to consider the crowdsourced data and [examine OSM data quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622818312839#sec4) while in [Germany the community of mappers is large](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267989860_Quantitative_Studies_on_the_Data_Quality_of_OpenStreetMap_in_Germany). Also OSM developed as a road mapping project, therefore other objects (such as renewable energy generators) could have started being mapped later at different rates in different regions. Therefore, it is crucial to consider OSM data with a pinch of salt when analysing results. Nevertheless we still consider that OSM data can provide interesting insights and provide data that otherwise would not be freely and openly accessible.

```{r}
#| message = F,
#| warning = F,
#| results = F,
#| eval = F

# import csv file containing OSM data
osm = readxl::read_excel("data/osm.xlsx")

# let's extract year from the date
osm_clean = osm |> 
  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(timestamp)
                ) |> 
  dplyr::select(-1)

# save our new osm dataset
# write.csv(osm_clean,
#           "osm_clean.csv")

```
